# Frontend for the Madali Project

This folder contains the frontend application for the Madali project. It integrates with the local testnet and simulated backend to create an interactive and functional demo. The application allows users to manage classes, students, teachers, courses, grades, and mint certificates, while also presenting these data points to the user.

Due to challenges encountered during development, certain features—such as advanced updates and additional data presentation capabilities—were omitted to prioritize functionality. There may also be some potential bugs.

Despite these omissions, the application successfully fulfills the core requirements specified for the product in the project plan.

### Missing Custom Assets

As outlined by the instructor, the primary focus for grading is on the code and functionality of the project rather than additional styling or custom assets. Therefore, placeholder assets and basic styling were used for this version.

In the future, custom designs and assets could be implemented to enhance the visual and user experience.
