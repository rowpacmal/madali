The initial tests have been successfully completed. However, further testing is recommended before proceeding to the next stage of deployment.

The reason I am holding off on additional testing at this stage is that I am confident the contracts need to be revisited, and potentially reworked. To avoid wasting my limited time, I have chosen to focus on the current state of the work and move forward with what I have for now.

While the contracts are functional, there may be underlying bugs or deprecated code that could pose issues in the future.

I aimed to deliver the contracts and tests in a presentable state despite some challenges during development. While this required keeping the implementation somewhat lightweight for now, I plan to address any bugs or inconsistencies in future iterations.
