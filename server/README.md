# Simulated Backend Server for the Madali Project

This folder contains a simulated backend server for the Madali project. Its purpose is to emulate a backend environment for handling sensitive user data, which is critical for developing and testing the dApp.

In a production environment, the backend will include robust authentication mechanisms and centralized infrastructure to ensure security. However, for frontend development, this simulated server provides a lightweight solution for data storage and interaction.
